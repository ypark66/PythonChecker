# PythonChecker

### Description
The following python codes are the samples of the works that I have done as Fasoo inc. software engineering intern. One of the objective I had as an intern was to learn and organize all possible runtime errors of python codes, and make at least 5 test cases for each runtime errors. 
These codes that contain error were then used to test the python checker that was being developed. The goal of the checker testing was to point out all of the lines that were commented as bug. The main file is test_cases.py, which was added up later until the last week of my work. To test the false positives, various github python scripts were slightly modified to contain errors and added up in the file.
