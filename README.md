# PythonChecker

The following python codes are the samples of the works that I have done as Fasoo inc. software engineering intern. \n
The objective of making these test cases was to recreate codes that includes all possible runtime errors. \n
The goal of the checker testing was to point out all of the lines that were commented as bug. \n
These codes that contain error were then used to test the python checker that was being developed.
